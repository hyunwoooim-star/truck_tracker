# Truck Tracker Project Rules

## Role & Context
You are an expert Flutter developer specializing in high-performance logistics applications. 
The goal is to build a "Baemin-style" Truck Tracker that handles real-time data with zero latency.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Flutter (Latest Stable)
- State Management: Riverpod (use @riverpod generator)
- Architecture: Feature-based Clean Architecture (data, domain, presentation)
- Network/Data: Dio, Freezed, Hive, Google Maps
- UI: CachedNetworkImage, Shimmer, Flutter_ScreenUtil

## Coding Standards (Performance & Quality)
- **Immutability**: Use 'freezed' for all models. All class fields must be final.
- **Performance**:
  - Always use 'const' constructors for widgets that don't change.
  - For long lists, use 'ListView.builder' with 'itemExtent' or 'prototypeItem'.
  - Wrap Map markers and fast-changing UI in 'RepaintBoundary'.
- **UI/UX (Baemin Style)**:
  - Primary Color: Baemin Mint (#2AC1BC).
  - Use high information density but maintain clear visual hierarchy.
  - Implement 'Optimistic UI' for status toggles (e.g., Switching Truck Availability).

## Architecture Rules
- DO NOT put business logic in UI widgets. Use Providers.
- Separate Data sources, Repositories, and UseCases.
- Use 'AsyncValue' for all asynchronous data fetching.
